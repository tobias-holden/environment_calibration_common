        Add a vaccine + vehicle drug intervention to approximate efficacy of SMC or PMC, as specified in **campaign_type**,
        to the campaign. This intervention uses default parameters corresponding to SMC with SPAQ and PMC with SP, if not
        otherwise specified via vacc_param_dic, drug_param_dic. The vehicle drug instantly clear parasites (blood stage +
        liver stage) and the prophylactic effect is added by the vaccine event.

        Campaign type specifications:
        For SMC, the drug event (MDA drug campaign) is initiated at the specified simdays and generates a broadcast event
        that is used to trigger the vaccine event without delay.
        For PMC, the drug event (MDA drug campaign) is triggered when the individual reaches the eligible age, which is
        broadcast using a birth-triggered triggered_campaign_delay_event, and similar to SMC, the vaccine campaign is
        triggered by the drug event broadcast without delay.
        PMC supports inter-individual-variation (IIV) in initial vaccine efficacy, and delay_distributions around
        specified age to receive the event.

    Args:
        campaign: campaign object to which the intervention will be added, and schema_path container
        campaign_type: Type of drug campaign. Default is **SMC**.
            Available options are:
            * SMC
            * PMC
        start_days: List of start days (integers) when the drug regimen will
            be distributed. Due to diagnostic/treatment configuration,
            the earliest start day is 1. When trigger_condition_list is used
            then the first entry of start_days is the day to start listening
            for the trigger(s).
        coverages: List of effective coverage levels per round of the campaign (fraction of people who receive the
            campaign at each round).

            Examples::

                [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8] or  [0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5]

        target_group: A dictionary of to specify age range for SMC or age-touchpoints for PMC. Default is Everyone.

            Examples::

                 {'agemin': x, 'agemax': y} , if campaign_type = SMC
                 {'1': 76, '2': 106, '3': 274, ...} , if campaign_type = PMC

        vaccine_param_dict: dictionary of parameters for vaccine to use with this intervention.
            keys expected: 'vaccine_initial_effect', 'vaccine_box_duration', 'vaccine_decay_duration'
            'vaccine_decay_duration' will be converted to vaccine's Decay_Time_Constant by
            vaccine_decay_duration/log(2)

            Examples::

                {'vaccine_initial_effect': 0.598, 'vaccine_box_duration': 21.7, 'vaccine_decay_duration': 1.18}

        drug_param_dict: Dictionary of three parameters for initial parasite clearing efficacy (drug campaign).
            Default: Fitted parameters for SMC-SPAQ and PMC-SP.

            Examples::

                {'drug_irbc_killing': 18.6, 'drug_hep_killing': 1.5, 'drug_box_day': 2.0}

        delay_distribution_dict: Dictionary of lists of distribution parameters. Distributions allowed:
            "GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION","LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION", "CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION".
            for age-touchpoints, there is also an internal offset (please see code)
            for "CONSTANT_DISTRIBUTION", only 'distribution_name' is used, age-touchpoint is used as the constant
            for "GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION", 'delay_distribution_mean' is ignored, age-touchpoint is used as mean,
            std is used directly.
            for "LOG_NORMAL_DISTRIBUTION", 'delay_distribution_mean' is converted to mu with
            np.log(tp_time_trigger + mean) - ((1 / 2) * std ** 2)) and std is used directly as sigma

            Examples::

                {'delay_distribution_name': df['distribution_name'],
                 'delay_distribution_mean': df['distribution_mean'],
                 'delay_distribution_std': df['distribution_std']}

        node_ids: The list of nodes to apply this intervention to (**Node_List**
            parameter). If not provided, set value of NodeSetAll.
        ind_property_restrictions:  List of IndividualProperty key:value pairs that
            individuals must have to receive the diagnostic intervention.
            For example, ``[{"IndividualProperty1":"PropertyValue1"},
            {"IndividualProperty2":"PropertyValue2"}]``. Default is no restrictions.
        listening_duration: Length of time, in days, for which the triggered event will be listening for the triggers
        target_residents_only: When set to True the intervention is only distributed to individuals that began the
            simulation in that node.
        trigger_condition_list: List of events that will begin a triggerable
            campaign if campaign_type is SMC. If campaign_type is PMC, campaign is triggered by birth per default.
        check_eligibility_at_trigger: If triggered event is delayed, you have an
            option to check individual/node's eligibility at the initial trigger
            or when the event is actually distributed after delay. (for example, a person might've aged out of the
            intervention before the initial trigger and the intervention distribution)
        receiving_vaccine_event_name:  Event to send out when person received vaccine.
            Default: 'Received_<campaign_type>_VaccDrug'
        receiving_drugs_event_name: Event to send out when person received drugs.
            Event name needs to include 'Received_Vehicle' in it, as otherwise overwritten in drug_campaigns function
            (see drug_campaigns.py L247)
            Default: SMC: 'Received_Vehicle' ; PMC: 'Received_Vehicle_X' with X being number of PMC dose
        num_iiv_groups: Number of individual drug response groups.
            If >1, ind_property_restrictions is set to {'DrugResponseGroup': val} if campaign_type = PMC, not used for
            SMC. Default: SMC: Not used. PMC: 1, IIV only acts on the vaccine event, not the drug event
        receiving_drugs_event: Specify whether to deploy the parasite clearing drug event or the vaccine event only.
            Default: True
            Exception: for PMC, set to False
